# html-template
A started template for HTML project.
Note that we organize the project in a way that is easy to maintain and understand:
- `css` folder for CSS files (although we are not expected to use CSS much)
- `js` folder for JavaScript files.
- `img` folder for images (you can also use internet images by providing the URL, but it is better to have a local copy)
The default file should be named `index.html` and should be in the root folder.
You can of course create additional HTML files and link them to the main file.

## Authors
Always include all authors of the project, with their full names and emails (@edu.hac.ac.il).
<p>Email (as appearing in moodle): student@hac.ac.il</p>
